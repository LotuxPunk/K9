# K9

# 1.13 repo here https://github.com/LotuxPunk/K-9-1.13

I saw the mod with a TARDIS, and I thought there was something missing in Minecraft on Doctor Who, K9!

If you didn't know it K9 is literally the Doctor's robot dog (a bit forgotten in the 2008 season) and so I put myself in the head to create this mod. This is my first mod, but I know java, so it should pass.

## Planned Features

- [x] Make K9 from complicated to have materials.
- [ ] K9 can pick up items,
- [x] K9 can defend you,
- [x] K9 can serve you as a mini chest
- [ ] K9 can be assigned to a task if you do not need it.
- [x] K9 can keep you company
- [x] K9 can help you to pilot the TARDIS
- [ ] K9 may prepare cookies for you
- [x] K9 will need to recharge
- [ ] K9 may become President of the United States
- [ ] and many other things...
